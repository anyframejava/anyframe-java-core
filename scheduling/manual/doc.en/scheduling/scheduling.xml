			TaskExecutor is an interface that is defined by extending java.util.concurrent.Executor. 
			It defines execute(Runnable task) method to execute assigned task. 
			Various TaskExecutor implementations are provided in Spring, 
			and for information on each implementation, refer to 
			<ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html#scheduling-task-executor">TaskExecutor types</ulink> 
			in Spring Documentation.
		</para>
		<para>
			To develop TaskExecutor that executes a specific task using TaskExecutor provided by Spring, 
			define the Spring TaskExecutor property based on XML, 
			and inject Spring TaskExecutor that is defined in TaskExecutor to be implemented. 
			Task can be executed within TaskExecutor by calling the execute() method of injected Spring TaskExecutor, 
			and Task Execution should implement its own rules. 
			On the other hand, the task implemented in thread format will be managed in Thread Pool 
			according to the specific characteristics of Spring TaskExecutor implementation.

				Like the code above, @Async method can have an input parameter or return value unlike @Scheduled method.

				and Caller can find the results of methods that shut down execution asynchronously, 
				through Future object's get() method.
